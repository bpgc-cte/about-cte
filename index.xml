      <description>Center for Technical Education (CTE) is a department headed by Prof Bharat Deshpande, HOD, CS/IS, for the purpose of imparting knowledge on application oriented courses/topics.
 The idea is to build a sustainable system for passing knowledge from seniors to juniors. In the sense that juniors wanting to learn a new field may benefit more by learning the basics from their seniors quickly and building much more on top of that rather than the DIY(Do It Yourself) approach from scratch.</description>

      <description>To serve as a platform for research activities on campus. We are looking to collaborate with companies in the form of undertaking their projects (simpler to start off with) along with a mentor, to further provide a real industry exposure to students early on and for the companies to eventually build a talent pool on our campus.
What&amp;rsquo;s in for the students taking the courses? : The students who successfully complete the course,get an certificate on the institute&amp;rsquo;s letterhead signed by Prof.</description>
