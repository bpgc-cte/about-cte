    <p>Center for Technical Education (CTE) is a department headed by <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/bmd/profile">Prof Bharat Deshpande, HOD, CS/IS</a>, for the purpose of imparting knowledge on application oriented courses/topics.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The idea is to build a sustainable system for passing knowledge from seniors to juniors. In the sense that juniors wanting to learn a new field may benefit more by learning the basics from their seniors quickly and building much more on top of that rather than the DIY(Do It Yourself) approach from scratch.</p></li>

<li><p>To expose students early on to the popular research areas in Engineering to broaden their knowledge base rather than simply sticking to the academic curriculum.</p></li>

<li><p>We employ a mentorship model, with 3rd or 4th year students teaching under the guidance of faculty members and 2nd year students acting as mentors for the course. This helps us ensure sustainability.</p></li>

<li><p>The courses are designed to be more practice oriented and some evaluation components are Hackathon&rsquo;s and a coding assignment or a term project in a few courses.</p></li>

<li><p>Each course has a faculty mentor assigned,who oversees the quality of the course being taught.</p></li>

<p>To serve as a platform for research activities on campus. We are looking to collaborate with companies in the form of undertaking their projects (simpler to start off with) along with a mentor, to further provide a real industry exposure to students early on and for the companies to eventually build a talent pool on our campus.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-in-for-the-students-taking-the-courses">What&rsquo;s in for the students taking the courses? :</h2>

<p>The students who successfully complete the course,get an certificate on the institute&rsquo;s letterhead signed by Prof. Bharat Deshpande. These certificates are something they can brag about ,be it placements,M.S. applications, and especially internships applications.</p>

<h2 id="research-at-cte">Research at CTE</h2>

<p>This semester we are having the following courses:<br />
1.  Intro to programming using python.<br />
2.  Vehicle design and dynamics.<br />
3.  Introduction to deep learning using tensorflow.
4.  Computer Vision using neural networks.<br />
5.  Introduction to Maya.
6.  Intro to robotics.<br />
7.  Intro to Object Oriented Programming.</p>
